Title: Creates a plasticity phenotype using features that correlate with PCA basis vectors

Description: Package contains five functions which work towards determining a plasticity phenotype. 
    The first (cum_var) identifies basis vectors that contain a specified amount of cumulative variance in PCA (e.g. PCA function in FactoMineR package). 
    The second (amplitude_plots) plots the amplitudes of each variable about the PCA basis vectors identified using cum_var.  
    The third (feature_matrix) allows the user to create new features, determined by the user based on the output of amplitude_plots. The function then tests whether they are correlated with the basis vectors obtained from the PCA (e.g. PCA function in FactoMineR package).
    The fourth (plasticity_phenotype) creates a colour-coded matrix of stacked horizontal bars representing the group averages for each feature identified in feature_matrix.
    The fifth (phenotype_boxplots) creates a series of boxplots to demonstrate expression levels of each feature, color of boxplots taken from plasticity_pheotype.
